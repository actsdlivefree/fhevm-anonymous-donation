# FHEVM Anonymous Donation DApp

## Project Introduction (152 words)

Introducing the world's first mathematically private donation system, our FHEVM Anonymous Donation DApp harnesses Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption Virtual Machine to revolutionize charitable giving on blockchain.

### üîí Revolutionary Privacy Protection

Traditional donation platforms compromise donor privacy. Our solution maintains donation amounts encrypted throughout the entire process. Advanced homomorphic encryption enables computations on encrypted data without decryption, keeping individual contributions mathematically private while allowing project owners to access aggregated statistics.

### üöÄ Advanced Technology Stack

Deployed on Ethereum's Sepolia testnet, the platform integrates:
- Zero-knowledge proofs for cryptographic verification
- Homomorphic operations on encrypted values
- Blockchain-based decentralized security
- Modern React UI with MetaMask integration

### üíù Privacy Meets Accountability

Donors contribute anonymously with guaranteed mathematical privacy, while project owners gain insights through encrypted analytics. This breakthrough balances donor confidentiality with data-driven charitable operations.

### üåê Instant Deployment

The application exports as static files for immediate deployment on any web hosting platform. From Vercel to traditional servers, our lightweight DApp delivers enterprise-grade privacy without server dependencies.

Join blockchain's privacy revolution with our FHEVM-powered anonymous donation system.
